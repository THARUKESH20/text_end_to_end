Image Captioning with VGG19 and Flask
Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end image captioning system using a VGG19 model for feature extraction and an encoder-decoder architecture for generating captions. The application is wrapped in a Flask web service that allows users to upload images and receive captions in return.

Architecture
The project consists of the following key components:

VGG19 Model: Pre-trained on ImageNet, used for feature extraction from input images.
Encoder-Decoder Architecture: LSTM-based model for generating captions.
Flask Web Service: Provides a web interface for uploading images and receiving captions.
Setup
Prerequisites
Python 3.7+
Virtual environment (optional but recommended)
Installation
Clone the repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-captioning-vgg19-flask.git
cd image-captioning-vgg19-flask
Create and activate a virtual environment (optional)

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required packages

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the VGG19 model weights and place them in the appropriate directory

bash
Copy code
# Ensure the weights file is named vgg19.h5 and placed in the models/ directory
